# Study of certain Probabilities in some Board Games

### Content
The aim is to study the probability of important events in different board games and card games, using Combinatorics, Statistics and Python Programming. Each script corresponds to a different game.

### Roadpam
This project started many years ago, It is documented in Spanish and code style is not the best. Also .py scripts should be replaced by Jupyter Notebooks. I'm working to fix that.
