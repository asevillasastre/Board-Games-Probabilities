# Study of certain Probabilities in some Board Games

### Content
The aim is to study the probability of important events in different board games and card games using Combinatorics, Statistics and Python Programming. Each script corresponds to a different game.

### Roadmap
This project started many years ago. It is documented in Spanish. I should improve its code style and replace .py scripts with Jupyter Notebooks. I'm working to fix that.
